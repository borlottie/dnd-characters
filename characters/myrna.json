        "Wild Shape":"You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\n\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\n* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\n\n* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\n\n* You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast.\n\n* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\n\n* You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.",

		"Backstory":"My mother was considerably more dragonlike than me. When I was growing up, the two of us tried to travel as much as we could (it was a little less cold then and my mother had some low firey abilities she used to keep us both warm) as neither of us found the dreary repetition of life in the cities (which were too hostile and grim for our tastes anyway) to be to our liking. She never spoke of my other parent (if indeed I had one), and I sensed that this meant I shouldn’t ask.\nDuring all our trips, we spent a lot of time looking at the stars, especially when I was very young as my mother was able to keep me warmer even when we were quite exposed. We spent many nights out in the open, gazing at the stars. I started drawing the constellations, adding my own annotations, diagrams and musings. I could feel the weighty power held by the stars and I just *knew* they held secrets if I just figured out how to unlock them.\nOur trips got shorter and shorter as my mother was grew weaker from the cold. I tried to help by learning a few small fire spells from her but despite my best efforts, they weren’t enough. Eventually, she had to leave. The cold was getting to her too much, and she couldn’t keep herself warm, let alone me. So our last trip was to a nearby city, AAA,  that she hoped I would be safe in. My mother dropped me off there before leaving to try to make her way to the elemental plane of fire or somewhere else warmer. (This was about 3 years ago.)\nThe city she left me in was heavily frequented by a group of druids (The Druidic Association for Moon-Watchers, or the “damw”) who live in its outskirts and worship the moon. These druids earn money and reputation by casting long term plant growth on the city (to promote crop growth etc) in return for a share of the produce. They also cast short term plant growth to produce fuel for themselves, which is how they’re able to live closer to the edges of the city than most. As a result, they are well respected in the city, and food and fuel are cheaper there than in other cities, however the residents of the city choose to carefully limit exports to preserve this. (They believe produce of the city should be used for the betterment of the city, and they’re not going to allow themselves to be exploited by bigger cities). The city is pretty small and has a strong community who generally align with communist ideals.\nI began spending time with the damw, admiring their abilities. Throughout the month, they spend spare spell slots casting plant growth on vines and saplings in their own hothouse, then drying out the resulting wood. On each full moon, they travel a day or so out of the city with all their firewood and build big bonfires to keep warm, spending a night or two wild shaping into wolves (many of them aspire to become lycans) and staring at the moon in general. I would go with them, taking the opportunity to study the stars like I used to and making detailed constellation maps, trying to absorb as much knowledge as I could from them. They readily shared their expertise and I began to pick up some of their habits and spells. They taught me to connect to the moon, stars and other nature, telling me that soon I would be able to forge my own path and develop new abilities separate from theirs. In the few years of time I spent with the damw, I learnt druidic, basic spellcasting and how to wild shape.\nI came to Dad a few months ago when the damw, hoping to expand and build relations with other cities, sent a group of members there asking for work and offering to teach their plant growth techniques and provide their services to the city in exchange for help upgrading AAA’s BoHD. The whole thing fell apart quickly (the nihilists were in power in Dad and they didn’t care enough to help) and the druids that had travelled to Dad dispersed, with most of them returning to AAA. But I stayed, hoping to find more different kinds of druids in Dad and learn a larger variety of skills. Since then I have been trying to stay warm and find work in Dad."
